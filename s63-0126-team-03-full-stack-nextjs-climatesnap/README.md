🌍 ClimateSnap – Climate Data Visualization Dashboard


## 🔍 Code Quality & Consistency (Sprint‑1)

Strict TypeScript prevents runtime bugs by enforcing strong typing and removing unused code.

ESLint enforces best practices and avoids common mistakes.

Prettier ensures consistent formatting across the team.

Pre‑commit hooks stop bad code from entering the repository.

This setup ensures a clean, maintainable, and professional codebase for future sprints.
